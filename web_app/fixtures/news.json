That's Orwellian.\"<p><p>In the private sector, it is harder to tell whether the use of facial recognition has decreased over the past year - there is no directory, no list of when and where it is used.<p><p>But on Monday, it was announced Disney World was to trial facial-recognition technology for a month.<p><p>Its system takes an image of a customer's face and converts it into a unique number, which is associated with the form of admission used for entry into the theme park.<p><p>The idea is to cut waiting times, with Disney saying it wants a more \"touchless experience\".<p><p>FIRST LOOK: Going Through New Facial Recognition Park Entry Procedure at Walt Disney Worldhttps://t.co/nLTFTHkntv pic.twitter.com/JBlrEcqzeg<p><p>And crucially, the technology does not require guests to take off their masks.<p><p>Even before the pandemic, research had been under way on how facial recognition could work with masks.<p><p>In Japan, NEC had been working on a system for people who wear masks because of allergies.<p><p>And in January, it announced one it said was 99.9% accurate.<p><p>It works out whether someone is wearing a mask and then focuses on the uncovered areas, such as the eyes and forehead.<p><p>And the company wants to sell it for security checks in office buildings and other facilities.<p><p>\"Touchless verification has become extremely important due to the impact of the coronavirus,\" NEC told Reuters.<p><p>So once again, the pandemic, rather than hindering facial recognition, is being used as a reason to use it.<p><p>\"Early on in the pandemic, we thought one of the very few silver linings could be the decline in facial-recognition technologies - but we've absolutely found that it's the opposite,\" Ella Jakubowska a campaign officer at pressure group European Digital Rights, says.<p><p>\"The pandemic has unfortunately provided cover for companies to push out to what are effectively mass-surveillance infrastructures, under the guise of public health.<p><p>\"A lot of companies have seen it almost [as a] challenge to develop technologies that can even more incisively identify people in public.\"<p><p>It has also been announced facial recognition will be used at the Olympics, due to start this July in Japan.<p><p>It is not yet clear what for - but there will be strict rules restricting shouting and singing, and foreign visitors will be unable to attend.<p><p>Already, the technology had been used to check whether people were wearing masks at sporting events, the Japan Times reported.<p><p>Facebook too is reportedly considering building facial recognition into its upcoming smart glasses, despite privacy activists' concerns it could be used by stalkers.<p><p>Facial recognition remains hugely controversial - and those controversies will remain, whether or not masks are being worn.<p><p>Facial recognition identifies people wearing masks<p><p>Emotion-detecting tech 'must be restricted by law'<p>",

According to salary comparison website PayScale, the average developer salary is around 74,000.</p><p></p><p>Carl Mungazi studied journalism at university, and worked as a local journalist in Luton for four years before making the switch to developer in 2016.</p><p></p><p>His route into coding initially came from his desire to build a news aggregator for the local area, something he'd seen national publications build.</p><p></p><p>\"I wanted to basically find a way of being able to track the news being published in Luton,\" Carl says.</p><p></p><p>A developer friend helped him build the back end - the technology behind the scenes holding everything together - and Carl taught himself to use Javascript - a programming language popular for building websites.</p><p></p><p>It also helped kick-start a career change when the journalism project eventually fizzled out.</p><p></p><p>More Technology of Business</p><p></p><p>Choosing which computer language to learn really depends on what you want to do.</p><p></p><p>Python is a powerful, general purpose language and is often the first language taught to undergraduates on computer science courses.</p><p></p><p>It is widely used in business - YouTube, for example, is largely written in Python.</p><p></p><p>Ruby is another versatile language, popular with start-ups.</p><p></p><p>Whichever language a budding programmer opts for, there are vast resources online to support those teaching themselves. In his case, Carl says freecodecamp.org was particularly helpful.</p><p></p><p>Attending a boot camp is another popular option for career changers. Many of these have sprung up in recent years, offering intensive courses designed to equip participants with the skills needed to get that crucial first job.</p><p></p><p>Brenden Thornton chose this route, enrolling on a course offered by boot camp Flatiron School, whilst shifting careers away from being an National Basketball Association (NBA) cameraman.</p><p></p><p>\"One big advantage of going to a boot camp is having a set curriculum planned out for you. I didn't have to do any guesswork when it came to deciding what technologies to learn and how I was going to teach them to myself,\" he explains.</p><p></p><p>The support that comes with attending such boot camps was also key in his decision.</p><p></p><p>\"They really take the time to build a solid support team around you, not only through job opportunities, but also through career coaches who help you navigate the job search process.\"</p><p></p><p>One drawback of boot camps is that they can demand a lot of time and, for many, be prohibitively expensive. Many courses exceed 10,000.</p><p></p><p>A partial scholarship helped ease some of the financial burden for Brenden, but he still had a gruelling schedule.</p><p></p><p>During the boot camp his Monday to Friday routine involved getting up at 05:00 to drive for Uber and Lyft until 09:00. He would eat and study until 16:00 and then drive again until 21:00.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the path taken into coding, ensuring that so-called softer skills are not neglected is essential.</p><p></p><p>\"The skills that employers look for often are more than just the technologies,\" according to Barry Cranford, managing director of recruitment firm RecWorks.</p><p></p><p>\"The main thing that really makes a difference is whether they can do it as part of a team.\"</p><p></p><p>For Hannah Blair, attending hackathons at university were a useful way to improve these transferable skills, as well as connect with others.</p><p></p><p>\"Even if you're not heavily involved in the development of the product itself that you pitch at the end, there are just so many skills that you can take away,\" she says.</p><p></p><p>Having a public profile to highlight your work can also help when applying for roles.</p><p></p><p>Online platform Github is particularly popular among employers. \"It's like a portfolio for photography, you can dip into it and see what people have done,\" says Barry Cranford.</p><p></p><p>Finding a mentor to support you is another area that can provide a boost, he says, and could be a \"secret weapon\" for your career.</p><p></p><p>As with many industries, networking can also help build those first crucial contacts.</p><p></p><p>\"Attending any meet-ups can greatly increase your odds of landing a job,\" Brenden Thornton says. \"Network, network, network.\"</p><p></p><p>The challenges of getting that first job are not to be underestimated, however, particularly for career changers.</p><p></p><p>For Carl Mungazi it took 14 months to land his first role, as he came up against a problem familiar to many jobseekers.</p><p></p><p>\"One of the interviewers said to me that I had promise but they wanted me to get more experience.\"</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, whatever path taken into the industry, demonstrating a clear interest and passion for coding and programming must shine through.</p><p></p><p>\"It's a very challenging process that will really push your mental toughness, but if you're able to push through then it will seriously change your life,\" says Brenden.</p><p></p>",
